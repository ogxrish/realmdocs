## Established by Mad OG

Upon creating the 6-token structure for the Realm, [Mad OG](../power/mad-og.md) established the OG Bank to protect the value of the Realm.

## Initial Funding

The total supply of all 6 [tokens](../physics/tokens/) was securely transferred to OG Bank, with the exception of [$OGR](../physics/tokens/usdogr-og-realm.md), of which Mad OG retained 90%, safeguarding nearly all of the power of the Realm.

## Realm Liquidity

Ordained as the Protector of the Realm’s value and possessing its extensive 6-token supply, it became the duty of OG Bank to oversee critical frameworks of the Realm's token liquidity.

### Token Bonding

OG Bank's first step was to form liquidity bonds to establish connections between the tokens. This tied the tokens together and formed the first and most significant physical bonds of the Realm.

#### Realm Pools

[Realm Pools](../physics/liquidity-pools/realm-pools.md) were created to host specific bonds between the tokens. Significant portions of each token's supply (10%) are attributed to each Realm connection. These Realm pools also provide a direction of movement between the tokens.

#### Eternal Pools

Additionally, OG Bank created [Eternal Pools](../physics/liquidity-pools/eternal-pools.md) to pair tokens with outside world liquidity, giving the Realm's token structure several connections to otherworldly oracles.

### Safekeeping

The primary purpose of OG Bank was, and is, to supply tokens and establish liquidity for the Realm. Security and distribution of the remaining token supply is also important.

### Distribution

Upon creation, 70% of [$OGA](../physics/tokens/usdoga-og-alchemy.md) was distributed to [OG Lab](og-lab.md).

Upon creation, 60% of [$OGG](../physics/tokens/usdogg-og-gold.md) was distributed to [OG Mine](../games/og-mine.md).

## Source of Income

Although 100% of OG Bank's hosted liquidity is permanently locked, OG Bank does earn fees on the locked liquidity in [Realm Pools](../physics/liquidity-pools/realm-pools.md) and [Eternal Pools](../physics/liquidity-pools/eternal-pools.md).

Since the token balances of these pools represent the core flow of value across the Realm and are so large relative to the overall token supply, volume in the Realm directly translates to fee revenue for OG Bank.

OGs are encouraged to participate alongside OG Bank's locked liquidity to share this fee revenue. In this way, OG’s take advantage of the bank's permanent liquidity foundation to avoid locking any of their own tokens.

## Creation of OG Reserve

OG Bank created [OG Reserve](../games/og-reserve.md) to allow for the emergence of [$OGC](../physics/tokens/usdogc-og-coin.md), the common value of the Realm.&#x20;

Although not a source of income for OG Bank, [OG Reserve](../games/og-reserve.md) allows the value of [$OGG](../physics/tokens/usdogg-og-gold.md) to flow organically into the value of [$OGC](../physics/tokens/usdogc-og-coin.md), benefiting the expansion of the Realm holder base and the overall distribution of the Realm's value.
