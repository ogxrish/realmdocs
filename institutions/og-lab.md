## Created by Mad OG

[Mad OG](../power/mad-og.md) created OG Lab, a mysterious institution for which very little is known. It is believed that OG Lab's purpose is broad yet significant. Though veiled in mystery and obscurity, it is not wise to question Mad OG’s intentions when erecting the [Institutions](/broken/pages/BfVMfJiBaGoeEBpWw3Yx) of the Realm.

## Initial Funding

To establish OG Lab, [Mad OG](../power/mad-og.md) securely transferred a classified amount of SOL to OG Lab for initial funding, while [OG Bank](og-bank.md) transferred the total remaining supply (70%) of [$OGA](../physics/tokens/usdoga-og-alchemy.md) to OG Lab.

## Realm Liquidity

### Sanctioned Pools

Unannounced, OG Lab quietly established the Realm's [Sanctioned Pools](../physics/liquidity-pools/sanctioned-pools.md) to serve as an extension of [Eternal Pools](../physics/liquidity-pools/eternal-pools.md) and create additional liquidity connections to the outside world.

## Source of Income

OG Lab earns fees on the unlocked liquidity in [Sanctioned Pools](../physics/liquidity-pools/sanctioned-pools.md).&#x20;

Since these pools add convenient native SOL liquidity to the remaining Realm [tokens](../physics/tokens/), fee revenue for OG Lab is supportive to the ecosystem.

OGs are encouraged to participate alongside with OG Lab's liqudity to share in this fee revenue.&#x20;

It is believed that OG Lab created these [Sanctioned Pools](../physics/liquidity-pools/sanctioned-pools.md) with non-permanent liquidity in a modest size (compared to [Realm Pools](../physics/liquidity-pools/realm-pools.md) and [Eternal Pools](../physics/liquidity-pools/eternal-pools.md)) to allow for OGs of the Realm to actively participate in this class of the Realm's [Liquidity Pools](../physics/liquidity-pools/).
