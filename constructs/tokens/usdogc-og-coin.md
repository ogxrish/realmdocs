<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Realms_Coins_Coin.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Purpose

Established by OG Bank via OG Reserve as common value, $OGC is the utility token for fees and broad distribution, earned by reserving $OGG. It functions as the everyday currency for institutional transactions, promoting wider player participation, fee efficiencies, and value expansion across the Realm.

## Tokenomics

### Supply and Distribution

* Total Supply: 1,000,000,000,000 (1T with 7 decimals).&#x20;
* Allocation: 70% to OG Reserve; 10% to OG Bank.&#x20;
* Circulating Supply: Replenished by fees/unclaimed.

### Emissions Schedule

Fixed 274,000,000 per epoch; 10,000 epochs (7 years).

### Mechanics

* Burns/Replenishments: Unclaimed after 10 epochs returned; fees repurchase for replenishment.&#x20;
* Fees: Reserve/lottery/mining fees payable in $OGC.&#x20;
* Interrelations: Earned from locked $OGG; bonds with $OGG/$OGF in Realm; USDC in Eternal; SOL in Sanctioned.

## Institutions

* OG Reserve: Distributes via reserving.&#x20;
* OG Mine/Lottery: Used for fees.&#x20;
* Repurchase: Replenishes via buybacks.

## Utility

* Paying fees for mining, reserving, and lottery bidding.
* Earning through proportional rewards in OG Reserve.
* Repurchasing for replenishment and broad holder distribution.
* Bonding in pools for liquidity and external pairs (e.g., USDC).

## Liquidity Pools

Lock $OGG in slots (Alpha/Beta/etc.) for proportional rewards. Use for fees.
