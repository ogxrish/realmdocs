# $OGG - OG Gold

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Realms_Coins_Gold.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Purpose

Established by OG Bank via OG Mine as the scarce value source, $OGG is the scarce reserves of the Realm, mined to drive value flow into $OGC through reserving. It serves as the gold standard for intrinsic worth, central to scarcity-driven mechanics, where mining and locking create sustainable value chains and ecosystem replenishment.

## Tokenomics

### Supply and Distribution

* Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 (1B with 9 decimals).&#x20;
* Allocation: 60% to OG Mine; 10% to OG Bank.&#x20;
* Circulating Supply: Reduces via burns/unclaimed.

### Emissions Schedule

1% of remaining balance per epoch; asymptotic decrease, infinite but approaching zero.

### Mechanics

* Burns/Replenishments: Unclaimed after 10 epochs returned to Mine; fees repurchase $OGG for replenishment.&#x20;
* Fees: Mining fees (SOL/$OGC, escalating per epoch).&#x20;
* Interrelations: Locked in Reserve for $OGC; bonds with $OGA/$OGC in Realm; SOL in Eternal/Sanctioned.

## Institutions

* OG Mine: Distributes via mining.&#x20;
* OG Reserve: Locked to earn $OGC.&#x20;
* Repurchase: Replenishes via fees.

## Utility

* Mining for scarce emissions in OG Mine.
* Locking in OG Reserve slots to earn $OGC rewards.
* Repurchasing through fees for replenishment and scarcity.
* Bonding in pools for liquidity and value flow.

## Liquidity Pools

Mine with fees once/epoch; lock in Reserve slots. Provide in pools.
