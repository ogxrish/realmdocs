<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Realms_Coins_Matter.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Purpose

Established by Mad OG as a core element of the Realm, $OGM embodies the core building blocks of the Realm, supporting value distribution, liquidity connections, and structural integrations. It functions as matter-like essentials for ecosystem expansion, facilitating external bridges and foundational mechanics, with further details to be revealed over time.

## Tokenomics

### Supply and Distribution

* Total Supply: 1,000 (1K with 9 decimals).&#x20;
* Allocation: 10% to OG Bank for bonds; remainder coordinated with institutions.&#x20;
* Circulating Supply: Varies based on releases.

### Emissions Schedule

Pre-mined; no emissions specified.

### Mechanics

* Burns/Replenishments: Potential via unclaimed or repurchases.&#x20;
* Fees: Used in liquidity fees.&#x20;
* Interrelations: Bonds with $OGR and $OGA in Realm Pools; with cbBTC in Eternal Pools; SOL in Sanctioned.

## Institutions

* OG Bank: Manages bonds in pools.&#x20;
* Other: Supports external connections.

## Utility

* Supporting value distribution across institutions.
* Facilitating liquidity connections and external bridges (e.g., cbBTC pairs).
* Bonding with other tokens in Realm Pools for ecosystem integration.
* Potential for repurchases and burns to enhance scarcity.
