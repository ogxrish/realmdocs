<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Realms_Coins_Fool.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Purpose

Established by OG Bank via OG Lottery as primal degeneracy, $OGF is the high-risk token for luck and fate, bid on for jackpots. It embodies foolish gambles or fortunate winds, designed for degenerate high-stakes plays where bids fuel burns for scarcity or yield massive, unpredictable rewards.

## Tokenomics

### Supply and Distribution

* Total Supply: 1,000,000,000,000,000 (1Q with 4 decimals).&#x20;
* Allocation: 800T to OG Lottery; 10% retained by OG Bank.&#x20;
* Circulating Supply: Reduces via burns.

### Emissions Schedule

Starts at 1B per epoch, +1B each epoch; 1,265 epochs (3.5 years).

### Mechanics

* Burns/Replenishments: Unclaimed after 10 epochs burned; fees repurchase for burn (no replenish).&#x20;
* Fees: Bidding fees (SOL/$OGC, escalating until win).&#x20;
* Interrelations: Bonds with $OGC in Realm; SOL in Sanctioned.

## Institutions

* OG Lottery: Distributes via bids.&#x20;
* Repurchase: Burns via buybacks.

## Utility

* Bidding in OG Lottery for jackpot pools.
* Winning high-risk rewards (50% to last bidder, shared remainder).
* Fueling burns through repurchases for increased scarcity.
* Bonding in pools for liquidity in degenerate plays.

## Liquidity Pools

Bid with fees; last bidder wins 50%, others share 50%. Difficulty persists until win.
