## Purpose

Established by OG Bank via OG Lab for liquidity extension, $OGA enables the dark science of the Realm, creating Sanctioned Pools for SOL liquidity and shared fees. It facilitates alchemical transformations that extend the Realm's reach, allowing non-permanent SOL pairs, revenue sharing, and enhanced connectivity to external assets.

* Circulating Supply: Varies; distributed via pools.

### Emissions Schedule
