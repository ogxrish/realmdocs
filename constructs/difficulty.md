# 📈 Difficulty

## Proof of Work

The concept of Difficulty is derived from traditional applications of Proof-of-Work.

## Difficulty Level

Early during any process, minimal inputs are required to complete a particular task. Over time, performing a task becomes more difficult, therefore benefitting earlier participants by being "easier" or requiring less work or resources to complete. As participation increases, so does the "difficulty level"or required amount of total input.

## "Work" or Inputs

Within the Realm, work (or a measure of inputs) is most often measured in terms of transaction cost.

Each Institution operates on the same Difficulty Curve as applied to fees. [OG Mine](../games/og-mine.md), [OG Reserve](../games/og-reserve.md), and [OG Lottery](../games/og-lottery.md) all charge fees to interact with them in order to receive the appropriate tokens.

Fees for these Institutions increase (during each [Epoch](epochs.md) for OG Mine and OG Reserve, and upon each Pool reset for OG Lottery) according the to Difficulty Curve. The effect of this is for the operation cost of each Institution to increase with each subsequent Player.

## Difficulty Curve

The Difficulty Curve is tracked in SOL and can be computed as follows:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Fee = 0.005\*(count)^2
{% endhint %}

Of note is that the Realm's difficulty increases at an exponential rate, as opposed to linear, exacerbating the benefit to early participants and incentivizing early (discounted) participation during each operating period until the Difficulty is reset.
