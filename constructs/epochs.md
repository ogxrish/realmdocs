# ☀️ Epochs

## Units of Time

The entire Realm of OGs operates on a distinct time clock: Epochs.&#x20;

Each Epoch lasts for a total of 24 hours and resets at 00:00 UTC.

## Institition Cycles

All Institutions responsible for token emissions ([OG Mine](../games/og-mine.md), [OG Reserve](../games/og-reserve.md), and [OG Lottery](../games/og-lottery.md)) operate cyclically by the Epoch mechanism.&#x20;

At the turn of each Epoch, token emissions, rewards, and claims are processed based on the previous 24-hour activity.

## Universal Epoch

Currently, Epochs are tracked individually by each Institution. Therefore, each Institution may count its own Epoch (based on the age of the Institution).

The Universal Epoch (to be introduced soon) will serve the Realm as an official clock, representing the amount of time passed since the beginning of the Realm.
