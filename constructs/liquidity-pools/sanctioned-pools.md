# Sanctioned Pools

## Established by OG Lab

Created by [OG Lab](../../institutions/og-lab.md), Sanctioned Pools are regulated pools in which 5 Realm tokens are pooled to SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain.&#x20;

Sanctioned Pools establish a direct liquidity link to SOL for every Realm token, with the exception of $OGG, which already has an Eternal Pool with SOL.

## Alignment

Although 3 of the tokens ($OGM, $OGG, $OGC) already have [Eternal Pools](eternal-pools.md) in place, the creation of Sanctioned Pools gives each token without a Eternal pair to SOL a non-permanent Liquidity Pool with SOL.&#x20;

The effect of this is to greatly enhance on-chain liquidity of the entire Realm token ecosystem, as now each token has a direct path to native token liquidity on Solana.

* [OGR](../tokens/usdogr-og-realm.md) **is pooled with** SOL
* [OGM](../tokens/usdogm-og-matter.md) **is pooled with** SOL
* [OGA](../tokens/usdoga-og-alchemy.md) **is pooled with** SOL
* [OGC](../tokens/usdogc-og-coin.md) **is pooled with** SOL
* [OGF](../tokens/usdogf-og-fool.md) **is pooled with** SOL

{% hint style="warning" %}
$OGG does not have a Sanctioned Pool because it has an Eternal Pool with SOL.

## OG Participation

Although [OG Lab](../../institutions/og-lab.md) has provided an initial level of liquidity via Sanctioned Pools, it is not permanent, thus OGs are heavily encouraged to participate by adding their chosen Realm token with SOL into the following Sanctioned Pools:

<table><thead><tr><th width="156">Pair</th><th width="83">Fee</th><th>Meteora</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>$OGR-SOL</td><td>0.25%</td><td><a href="https://app.meteora.ag/pools/96LQ9z7NjykLDdsFrkbymut3su5JY5L55ieEeh1xHzgX">Link</a></td></tr><tr><td>$OGM-SOL</td><td>0.25%</td><td><a href="https://app.meteora.ag/pools/5fSVjPiCSCbDctyaXWssvHsZ8Bt6TYjWft14SRsYMmcp">Link</a></td></tr><tr><td>$OGA-SOL</td><td>0.25%</td><td><a href="https://app.meteora.ag/pools/CzpyCn19FPtyQEXvDJTNQq1r87DWmm3RViPEek1Edmns">Link</a></td></tr><tr><td>$OGC-SOL</td><td>0.25%</td><td><a href="https://app.meteora.ag/pools/AYQALsNFanvfqm6FPbziEj1mc8bP5izPDJWwHmrAJ6Xb">Link</a></td></tr><tr><td>$OGF-SOL</td><td>0.25%</td><td><a href="https://app.meteora.ag/pools/Hbb5mZ5ufp83WrAkCZ4rcMxQc4LrNUFEe7BD9b8ffmec">Link</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

This liquidity is not permanent and can be removed by OG Lab at any time.&#x20;
