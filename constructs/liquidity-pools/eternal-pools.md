# Eternal Pools

## Established by OG Bank

Created by [OG Bank](../../institutions/og-bank.md), Eternal Pools are official pools in which 3 Realm tokens are permanently bonded to outer world assets.

Further, these pairs establish a relative common asset association for the token order within the Realm.

## Alignment

In addition to providing comparative value to commonly known metrics of the world outside of the Realm's walls, it allows for outside connections, flows, and influence relating to what matters for the Realm's OGs.

* 10% [OGM](../tokens/usdogm-og-matter.md) **is permanently bonded to** cbBTC
* 10% [OGG](../tokens/usdogg-og-gold.md) **is permanently bonded to** SOL
* 10% [OGC](../tokens/usdogc-og-coin.md) **is permanently bonded to** USDC

{% hint style="warning" %}
$OGM, $OGG, $OGC have a total of 30% of their supply permanently bonded in both Realm and Eternal Pools.
{% endhint %}

## OG Participation

Although [OG Bank](../../institutions/og-bank.md) has locked liquidity in these pools forever, OGs can also participate in Eternal Pools by adding their chosen Realm token with the appropriate outer world asset into the following Realm Pools:
