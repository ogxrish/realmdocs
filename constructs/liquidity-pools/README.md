# ðŸ’§ Liquidity Pools

## Protocol Liquidity

To support the Realm's vast and extensive 6-[token](../tokens/) structure, [OG Bank](../../institutions/og-bank.md) and [OG Lab](../../institutions/og-lab.md) have established several key Liquidity Pools for the Realm.

The Realm's structured network of Regulated Pools operates as a dynamic engine, balancing the tokens with each other and outer world assets.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Liquidity Pools are a key component to the functioning of Realm tokens across the Realm ecosystem.

## Regulated Pools

The [Institutions](broken-reference) of the Realm host a structured framework of liquidity pools to ensure the proper environment exists for the Realm to be both liquid and scarce. Although OGs will likely continue creating new and unique token pairs, the Realm officially recognizes only 3 types of Regulated Pools:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### [Realm Pools](realm-pools.md)

All 6 Realm tokens are permanently and equally bonded to each other.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### [Eternal Pools](eternal-pools.md)

3 of the Realm tokens are permanently bonded to outer-world assets.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### [Sanctioned Pools](sanctioned-pools.md)

5 of the Realm tokens are liquidity boosted to blockchain native SOL.&#x20;
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="info" %}
All Regulated Pools are built on Meteora on Solana.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;All Regulated Pools are set at a 0.25% fee rate.
{% endhint %}

## OG Participation

OGs are heavily encouraged to participate in the activity of providing liquidity with their Realm tokens. As each OG participates in a different area of the Realm, the flow of tokens will vary for each player.

{% hint style="success" %}
In the early days of the Realm, participating in the Regulated Pools with Realm assets not only provides a value advantage to OG, but also supports the liquidity framework of the Realm.
{% endhint %}

OGs are also encouraged to set up their own Liquidity Pools outside of the Realm's Regulated Pools. Unique token pairs with Realm tokens supports the growth of the Realm, as does the creation of liquidity pools which may offer better, more competitive rates than Regulated Pools.

Individual links to participate in Regulated Pools can be found on the following pages.
