# 🎰 OG Lottery

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Lottery.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Established by OG Bank

[OG Bank](../institutions/og-bank.md) created OG Lottery to dispense [$OGF](../physics/tokens/usdogf-og-fool.md), the primal degeneracy of the Realm.

OG Lottery was created to be accessible to all OGs.

## Initial Funding

[OG Bank](../institutions/og-bank.md) securely transferred nearly all of the remaining supply of [$OGF](../physics/tokens/usdogf-og-fool.md) to OG Lottery (800T $OGF) for distribution within the Realm, except for 10% of $OGF, which OG Bank retained.

## Lottery Operations

While notable differences exist, OG Lottery functions similarly to [OG Mine](og-mine.md) and [OG Reserve](og-reserve.md). Specifically, OG Lottery dispenses [$OGF](../physics/tokens/usdogf-og-fool.md).

### $OGF Emissions

OG Lottery emits a constantly increasing amount of [$OGF](../physics/tokens/usdogf-og-fool.md) each epoch; beginning at 1B (1,000,000,000) $OGF per epoch and adding an additional 1B (1,000,000,000) $OGF to each and every subsequent epoch. Since the amount of $OGF emitted increases at a constant rate, more of the supply continues to circulate as time goes on. Based on this emissions schedule and the total supply of $OGF initially sent to OG Lottery for distribution, OG Lottery will continue to emit $OGF for approximately 1,265 epochs (or 3.5 years).\
\
&#xNAN;_\[Astute prize pool watchers may notice that during the OG Lottery reset of 12/2025, the first epoch after the reset was not 1B as designed but only 100,000 $OGF.  After the first prize pool \[post reset] was awarded on 12/22, this hiccup became immaterial to future prize pools.]_

### Bidding $OGF

OGs can bid for $OGF each epoch by visiting OG Lottery:

{% hint style="success" %}
[https://lottery.ogrealm.xyz](https://lottery.ogrealm.xyz/)
{% endhint %}

### Lottery Fees

OGs can bid any number of times each epoch by paying the Lottery fee, paid in either SOL or [$OGC](../physics/tokens/usdogc-og-coin.md).

### Lottery Winners

The Final Bid is considered the winner of each Lottery Pool. Unlike both [OG Mine](og-mine.md) and[ OG Reserve](og-reserve.md), winners of OG Lottery are not necessarily determined each epoch. Instead, the Final Bid is determined when an entire epoch passes without a bid by any player. The OG with the Final Bid receives 50% of the accumulated [$OGF](../physics/tokens/usdogf-og-fool.md) in the Lottery Pool, while all prior bids share the second 50% of the Lottery Pool, proportional to each player's number of bids (which includes any of the _OG with the Final Bid_'s bids prior to the final bid, if they made any).

### Difficulty Curve

Lottery fees (difficulty) increase with each new bidder. Unlike both [OG Mine](og-mine.md) and [OG Reserve](og-reserve.md) (in which difficulty resets each epoch), OG Lottery difficulty is reset only upon a successful winning Final Bid. Therefore, the difficulty curve continues to increase over multiple epochs (or until a Final Bid is confirmed).

### ~~Replenishing the Lottery~~

The Repurchase Program utilizes all collected reserve fees to buy [$OGF](../physics/tokens/usdogf-og-fool.md) back from the open market. However, in stark contrast to both [OG Mine](og-mine.md) and [OG Reserve](og-reserve.md), $OGF repurchased is burned. This reduces the supply of $OGF and does NOT function to replenish the OG Lottery.

#### Lottery Fees

All OG Lottery fees collected are used to buy [$OGF](../physics/tokens/usdogf-og-fool.md) back from the open market to be burned; ultimately functioning to reduce the circulating supply of $OGF.

#### Unclaimed $OGF

Additionally, [$OGF](../physics/tokens/usdogf-og-fool.md) won but not claimed within 10 epochs is burned, further contributing to the reduction function of $OGF.

## Unlocking the Degen

[$OGF](../physics/tokens/usdogf-og-fool.md) represents the primal degeneracy of the Realm, with OG Lottery being the institution responsible for its distribution. OG Lottery rewards those for being early (low difficulty, guaranteed prize), being late (winner takes the lion's share), and being vigilant (participating often to also tap into the second half of the Lottery Pool).

Through OG Lottery, OGs have the ability to attribute value to $OGF in order to tap into the ecosystem of Luck and Fate that awaits them.
