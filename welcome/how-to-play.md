Playing the game comes in many forms, as the Realm is a vast space with various moving parts. By design, this creates an unbound number of opportunities for OGs in the Realm to find their knack. As the Realm evolves, so will the opportunities.

## Mining

In the Realm of OGs, mining activities present a lucrative opportunity for OGs to capitalize on their resources. Through [OG Mine](../institutions/og-mine.md), seasoned players can engage by mining to extract valuable materials and resources crucial for crafting and trading. By leveraging their expertise and strategic insights, OGs can optimize their mining operations to ensure maximum outputs with minimal effort. The OG Mine offers a structured and rewarding environment, allowing OGs to continually refine their mining techniques and emerge as leading contributors within the Realm's bustling economy.

## Reserving

In the vast expanse of the Realm, players can choose to engage with [OG Reserve](../institutions/og-reserve.md) as a strategic avenue for farming [$OGC](../constructs/tokens/usdogc-og-coin.md) yield. By allocating their resources ([$OGG](../constructs/tokens/usdogg-og-gold.md)) to OG Reserve, players can earn returns on their holdings while actively participating in the economy. This mechanism provides a stable and passive income stream, rewarding players for their involvement and commitment. OG Reserve is designed to incentivize long-term participation, allowing players to benefit from accrued yields based on their contributions and the overall growth of the Realm's ecosystem.

## Holding

OGs can significantly impact the game's ecosystem by choosing to hold Realm [tokens](../constructs/tokens/), aligning their interests with the growth and success of the Realm. Holding tokens provides these players with a vested interest in the game, as the value of their holdings is directly tied to the overall performance and development of the Realm. By selecting to hold specific tokens, OGs can actively support the unique activities and sectors within the Realm that utilize these tokens, further contributing to the ecosystem's diversification and dynamic growth. This strategic holding fosters a deeper connection between players and the Realm, as their financial interests are intertwined with the game's evolution and prosperity.

## Liquidity

Players can utilize their Realm tokens to participate in a vast network of [liquidity pools](../constructs/liquidity-pools/), a strategic approach to securing and strengthening the Realm's financial ecosystem. By providing their tokens to these pools, players enhance the overall liquidity of the Realm, making it more robust and attractive for economic activities. This participation not only contributes to the stability and growth of the Realm but also allows players to earn fees from the transactions and various economic activities that occur across the network. Engaging in liquidity pools offers a dynamic opportunity for players to support the Realm and benefit financially from their involvement.

## Trading

OGs can contribute to the economic growth of the Realm by participating in trading activities. OGs capitalize on price arbitrage opportunities by exchanging Realm [tokens](../constructs/tokens/) with one another on the open market or with assets outside the Realm. This strategic trading contributes to the stability and growth of the Realm's economy as players exploit price disparities between different markets and tokens. Through this strategy, OGs can enhance their financial positions while contributing to the liquidity and dynamism of the Realm's economic ecosystem, fostering a robust and interconnected trading environment.

## Building

At any level of participation, OGs may build onto the Realm's existing framework by developing programs, apps, and side market economies. This open-ended opportunity grants builders the creative freedom to broaden the functionality and scope of the Realm, contributing to its innovation and expansion. By engaging in building activities, OGs have the power to establish new avenues for interaction and commerce, enriching the overall player experience and fostering a vibrant, evolving community.
