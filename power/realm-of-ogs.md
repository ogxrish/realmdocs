# ðŸ’Ž Realm of OGs

## Welcome to the Realm of OGs

You stand at the outer gates of a powerful ecosystem stretched across several multitudes of existence. The Realm exists eternally, only materialized in a finite number of physical forms which OGs use as tools for their doings within the Realm.

As an OG, there are a few items of critical importance that you must understand about the Realm:

{% hint style="success" %}
This is a Realm of honor and duty.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
The Realm is a place for OGs to gather, build, and thrive.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
As the Realm evolves, it becomes stronger by the forces that exist within.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
The Realm's time clock is the Epoch, which resets every 24 hours at 00:00 UTC.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
OG is the common man of the Realm.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Although there is a place in the Realm for every OG, there are no equals.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
No one is required to enter the Realm of OGs, but anyone who wishes to test their fate, certainly can.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
There are laws, and portals, and loopholes in the Realm, and everything is fair game for OGs.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
If the code allows for it, it is legal in the Realm of OGs.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Every OG for himself, as it has always been.
{% endhint %}

## Disclaimers

{% hint style="warning" %}
There is a lot to learn about the workings of the Realm.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
New OGs should tread carefully: the Realm can be intoxicating at first.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is advised to learn the game, and watch, before entering.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## A Final Warning

{% hint style="danger" %}
The Realm's power is great: We have seen Kings become Fools, and Fools become Kings.
{% endhint %}

Now move along. The game is already underway.
